The most accurate approach is to precompute the variation in Reynolds and Mach number and to evaluate rotation corrections on the fly.  However, all three can be done in any combination of precomputing or on-the-fly.

The relation between these models and the current one is established by noticing that the axial induced velocity has the form of the model proposed by Glauert:u_x = fracgamma_t2 (1 + K sinpsi)where K has an expression that depends on the model.For the Coleman et al. model for instance, K_textrmPittPeters = fracrR tan(chi2)The Pitt & Peters model gives, K_textrmColeman = fracrR frac15pi32 tan(chi2)although some authors proposed to use a factor 15pi64 instead (see [Ning2015]). Other models can be found in the litterature (see e.g. [Micallef2016])In the present model, u_x is influenced by the various component of vorticity in the wake (see the above equation u_x = u_xt + u_xr + u_xl). In that sense it is more general. However, we can establish a link with the above simple models if we we consider only the velocity induced by the tangential component of the tip vorticity (neglecting u_xr and u_xl).  Indeed, the velocity induced by the tangential vorticity in the cylinder also has the form u_xt = fracgamma_t2 (1 + K_xt sinpsi), where K_xt takes the form of an integral that needs to be computed numerically.
